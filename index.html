                <p>VisOil is a web application used to display real-time drilling data from a wellsite into a detailed interactive line-graph along with features for report creation, printing and adding notes for collaboration. Many exploration and production companies still use static graphs stored locally on desktops. These graphs need to be constantly updated manually by engineers, and have high costs both in time and labor and are prone to human error. With VisOil these issues are elliminated and you are also offered instant access to your drilling-data at anytime and from anywhere over the internet via secured access.</p>
